# Advent of Code 2017

I'm participating to the 2017 edition of [Advent of Code](http://adventofcode.com/2017/), a nice little puzzle game for developers. It consists in solving a couple of Christmas-related programming puzzles, and it doesn't matter what language you're choosing as long as you get the solution. I warmly suggest to give it a try yourself!

To get the input for the puzzles, you'll have to log in to the site above and get your own source. I'll add an `input.txt` file in each directory with a sample input to work with. If you're getting the input in a browser window from the game's site, you can open your developer tools of choice and set

```js
var input = document.body.textContent;
```

Be warned, though, that not every solution can be executed on the browser's console, as some are meant to be run on node.js.

[Here's the repository of my solutions](https://github.com/MaxArt2501/advent-of-code-2015) for the 2015 edition of Advent of Code, and [here's the one](https://github.com/MaxArt2501/advent-of-code-2016) for the 2016 edition.

## SPOILER ALERT

I'm publishing my solutions online, each in their own `day-##` directory, which will also contain the texts of the puzzles. The solutions are merely meant to be a reference for comparison, to see the tricks I'm using and, eventually, to discuss about improvements and new ideas.

So, if you still haven't found the solution and wish to do it on your own, this is the due **SPOILER ALERT**.
